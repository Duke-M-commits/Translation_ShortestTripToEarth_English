# RST localization TSV file for a build 1.3.6rc
#
# All files with tsv extension from the following directories are read on game start (relative to game installation):
#   Mods/
#   ../../workshop/content/812040/
#
# There are two ways to tell the game to use a specific language. One is by using cmd line arg
# "--language=German" and another option is to choose from the Language dropdown in the game.
#
# The game ONLY parses lines that:
# 1. start with ':' character. These are processing directives.
# 2. have at least 3 tab separated columns. These are dictionary entries. All strings are in UTF-8 encoding.
#
# Columns:
#  * "context/comment" just gives a hint where this line is in the game, it's not imported.
#  * "key" (case-sensitive) is a phrase matched in the game. If localization context is given (use-in column), both context and key must match.
#  * "translation" is what will be shown in the game.
#  * "max-len" is a hint how many characters approximately can the translation be without truncation or overflow. Not imported.
#  * "use-in" is empty by default, but localization context ids from usable-in column can be copied here to constrain where this line will be used.
#  * "usable-in" is a list of all localization context ids that can be copied into use-in. Not imported.
#
# use-in column format examples:
#  2035575234:Menu panel.prefab - points to one particular part inside menu prefab (that part has localization context id 2035575234)
#  310402963:Menu panel.prefab  - points to a different part inside menu prefab
#  2035575234:Menu panel.prefab; 310402963:Menu panel.prefab - points to both parts in menu panel
#  2035575234; 310402963 - short version of the previous line
#  2035575234:credits button in menu; 310402963:ship label in menu - same as previous line, but it shows that what's after ':' doesn't matter
#  Beam.cs - some parts of the game don't have loc ctx id, this is an example of it, it can't be used in use-in column
#
# A localization context is a non-changing integer assigned to some particular part of the game. The integer may be
# followed by some text, separated by ':', it is there just for commenting purposes and is ignored by the game.
#
# A longer guide how to edit this file and publish it in Steam Workshop is here:
# https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2244605825

# Display name should be the first non-comment, non-empty line. It marks that all the following lines are in that language.
:displayName English

# Plurals forms are used like described here, except the separator is '|'
